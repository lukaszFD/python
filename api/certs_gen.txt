# Description of the command:
#
# The following command generates a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL:
#
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
#
# Breakdown of the command:
# - `req`: Initiates a certificate request.
# - `-x509`: Specifies that the output should be a self-signed certificate.
# - `-nodes`: Tells OpenSSL not to encrypt the private key.
# - `-days 365`: Sets the validity period of the certificate to 365 days.
# - `-newkey rsa:2048`: Generates a new RSA private key with a size of 2048 bits.
# - `-keyout key.pem`: Specifies the output file for the private key.
# - `-out cert.pem`: Specifies the output file for the certificate.
